# Drum Kit

This is a simple web-based drum kit. The page presents drum buttons that can be clicked or triggered with your keyboard to play corresponding sounds.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve this directory using a local web server. All required images and sound files are already included in the repository.

Press the on-screen buttons or use their matching keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to play the drums.
